### Understanding`Juliaup` {#sec-juliaup}

`Juliaup` is a Julia version manager and is automatically installed when you install the Julia App from Microsoft App Store. `Juliaup` lets you add, update, and remove different Julia versions very easily.

**To use `juliaup`, you open your command line and type `juliaup` and the command you want to run.**

- `juliaup status` prints all the julia version installed in your PC.
- `juliaup add release` installed the latest stable version of Julia.
- `juliaup add 1.8.3` will install Julia 1.8.3.
    - To see the list of available julia version, run `juliaup list`
- `juliaup default 1.8.3` sets the default version of Julia in your PC as Julia 1.8.3. This also defines what version of Julia will be 
called while you start a Julia session in VS Code. 
- `juliaup remove 1.8.3` will remove Julia 1.8.3 from your PC.
